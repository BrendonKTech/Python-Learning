# Python Learning

Welcome to **Python Learning!** 🚀 This repository is designed to help beginners and intermediate learners master Python through structured lessons, coding challenges, and solutions. Each section includes learning material, five questions, and their solutions. I have learned through classes and also attempted using codedex.io but it wasn't super helpful (it is a very slow website).

## 📚 Sections Overview

| Section | Topic |
|---------|-------------------------------------------|
| 1.1 | Variables and Data Types |
| 1.2 | Operators |
| 1.3 | Control Flow (If-Else, Loops) |
| 1.4 | Functions |
| 1.5 | Lists, Tuples, Sets, Dictionaries |
| 1.6 | List Comprehensions |
| 1.7 | File Handling |
| 1.8 | Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) |
| 1.9 | Modules and Packages |
| 2.0 | Decorators, Generators, Multi-Threading |
| #.# | More to be added |

Each section contains:
- 📖 **Learning Material** – A concise explanation of key concepts.
- ❓ **Practice Questions** – Five exercises to reinforce learning.
- ✅ **Solutions** – Detailed answers for self-assessment.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone this repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/BrendonKTech/Python-Learning-Resources.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the desired section:**
   ```sh
   cd Python-Learning-Resources/1.1_Variables_and_Data_Types
   ```
3. **Open the Python files and start coding!**

## 🎯 How to Use This Repository

- Read the learning material before attempting the exercises.
- Try solving the problems without looking at the solutions first.
- Run the provided Python scripts to test your understanding.
- Use this as a reference for quick concept revision.
